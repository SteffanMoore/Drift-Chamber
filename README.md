# Drift-Chamber
## Explanation
This is a simulation of a drift chamber particle detector, made in my third year of university. It is based on a "multi-wire proportional chamber" from 1968 which was a gas filled box with a cathode on one side and anode wires on the other. When a cosmic ray enters the box, it ionises gas in its path producing electrons and positive ions (although only the electrons are measured in this detector). The electrons then drift towards the anode wires due to the electic field, giving a two dimensional image of the particle path.
